# CS 371p Blog Post #13

As the semester draws to a close, it is time for me to write my last blog post 
documenting my time in Professor Downing's CS371p: Object Oriented Programming
class. I have learned quite a bit about the language of C_++ and while I admit
that this class was more focused on the language than actual object-oriented
programming concepts, it was a fun and worthwhile experience. 
This post will be different from the rest as I'll be summarizing my 
entire semester in this class.

## Lectures
  The lectures for this class were fantastic and kept me engaged throughout the
  semester. Professor Downing is very knowledgeable about the topics we learn in 
  class and effective in explaining useful information concerning these concepts.
  Every lecture usually begins with a short quiz that covers topics from the 
  previous class or assigned readings from that week. As a student who is 
  worried about grades, this was probably my least favorite 
  aspect of the class as missing one question usually meant getting a failing quiz 
  grade. However, Professor Downing is very generous in giving free quiz grades and ends
  up dropping many quizzes at the end of the semester. This, along with Downing
  calling on random students throughout the lecture to answer questions, was an
  effective way to force students to stay accountable and keep up with the class.
 
## Projects
  The projects in this class had a fairly reasonable workload and Professor Downing
  even offered extra credit for working in a group of two. These projects were related
  to the concepts discussed in the lectures and played a great role in solidifying
  my understanding of the information Professor Downing was teaching us in lecture.
  At first, the required workflow of these projects may seem long and arduous but
  I found that this process and the tools we used, such as version control with 
  Github, Docker and continuous integration with TravisCI, parallel those used 
  in the workplace. 

## Tests
  As of writing this blog post, I have only taken one test that consisted of a 
  multiple choice portion in Canvas and a coding section in HackerRank. 
  I found the test to be straightforward and fairly reasonable, especially
  if you studied and paid attention in lecture. Professor Downing is clear on what
  he expects us to know before the test so this aspect of the course should not
  be a huge concern.

Overall, I had a great experience in this class and I would recommend taking this course.
I learned quite a bit about C++ and I personally found that the concepts we learn 
are useful to know for technical interviews. Furthermore, I enjoyed having Professor
Downing as a lecturer and I plan on taking his other course CS373: Software Engineering
in the near future.
