# CS 373 Blog Post #13

## What did you do this past week?
This past week was mainly focused on completing my project in NLP which consisted of making a question and answering system for a specific domain. Unfortunately, my group once again had one less member than the others so we had to dedicate some significant time in order to finish the project on time. Otherwise, I spent some time catching up on my biology readings and planning out these last two hectic weeks of school. At the end of the week, I was able to briefly relax by going to the CS Senior Sendoff dinner at Fogo De Chao.

## What's in your way?
There is quite a bit in my way as this next week begins. I have a group biology project due at the end of the week along with the last phase for Project IDB. In addition, I have neglected my online marketing class for an extended period of time so I need to also begin preparing for the final exam in that class. However, the most significant obstacle in my way is a television series called Game of Thrones. I started the series last week and I, unfortunately, have developed a habit of watching the show for many hours at a once whenever I have any free time. So, hopefully, I'll stop so I can graduate.


## What will you do next week?
I will begin next week by meeting with my Project IDB group and planning out the work for the rest of the week before the deadline. Meanwhile, I need to also meet with my biology group in order to discuss our plan for the project. Fortunately, this biology project is a completion grade so I will likely be able to dedicate most of my week to finishing the last phase for IDB. Our IDB group is hoping to finish most of the requirements before the deadline so that we can add some fun extras to our website before we conclude our semester-long work.


## What was your experience in learning about refactoring?
Although I understand the importance of learning about refactoring, I honestly found most of the lectures to be uninteresting. Regardless, I need to find ways to stay focused in lecture if we continue learning about refactoring as I recognize its importance when it comes to programming.


## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
An interesting tool that I used for my NLP project is [wit ai]( https://wit.ai/), a natural language processing engine that parses text or speech into structured data. Our group used this to parse the intent of questions for our question-answering system and found it easy to train and use. For anyone who is interested in making chatbots or applications involving speech recognition, Wit AI is an easy way to start!
