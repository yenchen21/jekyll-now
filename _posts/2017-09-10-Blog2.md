## What did you do this past week?
This past week I continued to adapt to my new routine for the semester, especially as many of my professors
have begun giving out assignment and project dates. Because I wanted to be more involved this semester, 
I also attended the kickoffs for CS student organizations such as ACM and CS Roadshow. On top of working on assignments and
attending these kickoffs, I went to Resumania on Friday in preparation for the career fair coming next week. 


## What's in your way?
Career Fair is coming up at the end of next week and I need to fit in all the 
preparation that comes with that along with my regular schedule. I need to do some
research on the companies that will be in attendance and make sure my resume is ready without
taking away too much time from my regular course load. 

## What will you do next week?
I hope to start the week productively and finish most of the assignments and projects I have due as soon as I can.
This will give me some time to properly prepare for the Career Fair at the end of the week.  

## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class is still very positive. With the first project underway, I'm learning
a lot about different software development tools and a normal project workflow. 
As I attend more of these classes, I'm beginning to appreciate how Professor Downing
keeps us engaged throughout the class. It holds students accountable for the material
and it personally helps me retain the information Professor Downing conveys in class. 
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
For those fairly new to Github, Markdown is the syntax Github uses for all forms of writing on the platform, including READMEs. 
Here is a [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 
I found that has helped me format my READMEs and other text on Github.
