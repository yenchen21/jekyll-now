## What did you do this past week?
This past week was a relatively normal school week for me as I did not have any tests or projects due. At the beginning of the week, I spent some time studying and practicing problems on HackerRank and LeetCode in preparation for a technical phone interview that I had on Tuesday. Aside from finishing assignments and going to class, the rest of my week mainly consisted of going in to work to make up for all the shifts I had to miss due to interviews.
## What's in your way?
At this point, a significant thing in my way is how far behind I am in my 
online class. Like I mentioned before, this is the first self-paced class that 
I have taken and I’ve been really irresponsible with keeping up. It is 
necessary for me to take the midterm in the next couple of weeks to be on pace 
to finish the class so I need to make sure I actually dedicate some time this 
week to catch up and prepare for the midterm.
## What will you do next week?
Next week, I plan to finish up the project we have due for this class with my 
partner and continue to catch up on my online classes. I intend to do this and 
any other assignments I have due this week as soon as possible so I can head 
home on Thursday for my father’s birthday without having to worry about any 
academic responsibilities.
## What's my experience of the class?
My experience in the class is still very positive. I continue to learn a lot 
about OOP concepts and I find that some of the topics we cover in class are 
very helpful to know for technical interviews.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
As a student, I’m always trying to find ways to save money and I recently made 
the switch to Spotify from Apple music to take advantage of their 
[student bundle]( https://www.spotify.com/us/student/?utm_source=us-en_brand_bundlegeneral_text&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_campaign=2017q3_us_us_premiumbusiness_hulu&gclid=CMGiqOu6hdcCFRacgQodcb8CUg&gclsrc=ds). For the same price as the reduced student Apple Music subscription, this bundle provides a similar service in Spotify and a Hulu subscription as well.
