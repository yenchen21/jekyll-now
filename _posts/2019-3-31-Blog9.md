## What did you do this past week?

  I spent most of this past week finishing up on the two group projects I had due. For the project due in this class, our group was unable to start doing substantial work on phase two of our website until the weekend leading up to this week. This forced us to work multiple late nights on the project before rushing a submission before the initial deadline. Fortunately, Professor Downing extended the deadline by one day, giving us some time to go back and clean up our submission. For my other project in NLP, my group worked near the end of the week to finish up our information extraction system and the accompanying write up. Because our group was short one member, this project also took some late nights to finish. Once the last project deadline passed, I was able to relax at the end of the week by watching some March Madness.
## What's in your way?
	With my two big projects out of the way, there is nothing substantial standing in my way. Because I dedicated most of my time last week to those projects, I need to spend some time catching up in my other classes.
## What will you do next week?
	I plan to start next week by catching up on class material in my other classes. Due to the previous busy week, I fell behind with my biology readings so I'll spend some time catching up on that. Otherwise, our project group for this class will meet and discuss our plans for the third phase of the project.
## What was your experience of Project #3: IDB2? (this question will vary, week to week)
	My experience with Project 3 was mixed. On one hand, our group had a clear plan for this phase and because each of my group mates had prior experience with various requirements of the project, we were able to delegate work efficiently. However, with Spring Break in the middle of this phase, there seemed to be very little time we could dedicate to the project. We felt rushed near the end of the week to meet the deadline, especially when we were struggling with making tests for our website.
## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
	For those who like to plan out project and assignments deadlines or set up reminders for upcoming tasks, I found [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com) to be a great way to do so.
