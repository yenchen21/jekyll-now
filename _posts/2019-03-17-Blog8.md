## What did you do this past week?
This past week was a very busy week for me. Because this last week was the week before Spring Break, many of my classes set project or exam deadlines during this time. Fortunately, my NLP professor extended the deadline for our information extraction project so I was able to dedicate most of my week to studying for my exam in this class as well as my other exam in biology. However, to make sure we did not fall too far behind, I briefly talked with my SWE group about our plan for the upcoming phase two deadline that is after the break. 
## What's in your way?
There is a lot to do for phase 2 for our IDB project and a large portion of the time left before the deadline is during Spring Break. While I enjoy the break,  I need to make sure I dedicate some time to working on the project so that the week after is not too stressful. Furthermore, my NLP project deadline got extended to the week after the break as well. My groups met briefly to delegate work that we can do separately so I'm hoping to achieve some progress over the break. 
## What will you do next week?
As I mentioned, I will likely spend a portion of next week working on the projects I have due after the break. I also plan to work brief shifts at my job to catch up on time I missed studying for my exams. Otherwise, I look forward to spending time with family and friends who are in town for the break. 
## What was your experience of Test #1?
I found test #1 in this class to be straightforward and easy. I have had experience coding in python prior to this class and I spent a substantial portion of the last week practicing coding problems that were similar to the ones we saw in class and on the test.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
For those of you in classes that require you to submit handwritten assignments through Canvas, [Genius Scan] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genius-scan-pdf-scanner/id377672876?mt=8) is a free app that lets you scan documents into PDFs with your phone. I found this app to be extremely useful when turning in handwritten worksheets/assignments, especially if the instructor doesn't allow a certain image file type to be uploaded.
