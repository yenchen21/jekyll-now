## What did you do this past week?
This past week began with my first exam of the semester in CS331. It was a bit stressful, especially with the GDC losing power right beforehand, but I'm glad I got it over with. Without a project assigned in this class, as well as no major assignments due
in any of my other classes, the first part of the week after my test was relatively relaxed.
Because of this, I was able to focus all my efforts on preparing for an interview
I had for CapitalOne on Thursday. 
## What's in your way?
We have our first test in this class on Thursday this week. I'm not exactly sure
what to expect at this point so I need to make sure I spend quite a bit of time
this week familiarizing myself with all the various concepts we covered so far 
in this semester. In addition, I have continued to slack in one of my online classes
so I plan to catch up this week. 
## What will you do next week?
As I mentioned above, most of this next week will be spent studying for our 
Thursday exam and catching up in my online class. I am also attending a live
jazz performance for one of my classes which will be a new and exciting 
experience for me. 
## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class continues to be positive. I find having to
implement our own version of various C++ functions and classes not only an effective way
to learn how these functions work but it also reinforces the various C++/OOP concepts
that make up these functions. 
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
For Mac users who are curious on what application Downing uses to open applications and
navigate his file system, it is the application launcher called [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html).
It acts as an upgraded spotlight search and provides features that serve to 
improve your productivity and workflow on your mac.
