## What did you do this past week?
This past week, I mainly focused on my projects for this class and my NLP class. For NLP, we began a project on Information Extraction, where we need to extract entities and the relationships between them. So, I spent the beginning of the week familiarizing myself with python libraries that could be useful for the project. For the project in this class, I spent most of my time during the week extracting data from the APIs we found and formatting them to be used in phase one. In addition, I spent some time learning the basics of React and HTML as I have had very little front-end experience before this class.
## What's in your way?
At this point, there is nothing significant currently in my way. I need to continue to learn different aspects of React and HTML to make sure that I can properly contribute to the group project in this class. Fortunately, there are plenty of helpful tutorials and references online so I think I learn enough quickly to make progress on the project.
## What will you do next week?
With the deadline for phase one coming up for the project in this class, the beginning of the week will be solely focused on completing the remaining requirements we have for our website. Afterward, I will need to split the rest of the week to working on my NLP project and to begin studying for the first exam we have for this class. As always, I'm hoping that after a week of productive work, I will be able to play some squash with the boys.
## What did you think of the talk by Jesse on security?
I thought the talk on security by Jesse was very interesting and it opened my eyes up to issues that I would not have thought of when it comes to making websites.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Whenever I made the switch over to Mac from Windows, I found that it was difficult to resize windows so that I could view multiple windows at the same time. This feature was built in on Windows but there weren't any keyboard shortcuts that would allow the same behavior on my Mac. Fortunately, I found the free Mac application [ShiftIt](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt) that mimics this behavior to allow quick window size manipulation through keyboard shortcuts.
