## What did you do this past week?
This past week, I continued following a typical school week routine. I spent
the beginning of the week finishing up the second project for this class with my
partner. Fortunately, we were able to finish the project early so I used the
extra time to catch up on my online classes. Towards the end of the week, I
started to study for an algorithms test that I have on Monday.

## What's in your way?
Like I previously mentioned, I have a test for algorithms on Monday that I need to
spend the weekend studying for. This is my first test of the semester so I want
to make sure that I study sufficiently and start off the semester strong. In
addition, I have an interview with CapitalOne the following Thursday so I need
to make sure I find time to prepare for that as well. 

## What will you do next week?
Next week, other than the events I mentioned above, I plan to register for
HackTX after my test on Monday. I've had a great experience at HackTX hackathon each year I've been at UT so I hope to be able to go again this year. 
## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class is still positive as I continue to stay engaged in
the lectures. However, I'm still a bit worried about the quizzes as I have recently not
been getting full points on them. Otherwise, I continue to enjoy this class as I'm
learning a lot of Object-oriented concepts that could be useful to know for upcoming
interviews. 

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week would be Stanford's [iOS course](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-10-apps-with-swift/id1198467120)
on iTunesU. I have recently started following this course in my spare time in hopes of learning
the basics of iOS app development and found it to be a great, free resource to do so.
