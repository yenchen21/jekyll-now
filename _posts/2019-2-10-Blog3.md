## What did you do this past week?
  This past week was a relatively normal academic week as I had no major projects due or exams. I spent the beginning of the week doing miscellaneous assignments or readings for my biology class and continued working on my group project for Natural Language Processing. I devoted the end of the week and the start of the weekend to work on the first project for this class. As I am getting used to the times and workloads of each of my classes this semester, I have finally been able to somewhat settle into a routine and find times during the day to be active or to do any other extracurricular activities.
## What's in your way?
  There is nothing significant currently in my way. However, the due date of the first project in this class falls on the same day as my first biology midterm next week. Thus, I need to stay mindful of how I use my time at the beginning of next week in order to make sure I am properly prepared for my exam. Fortunately, I was able to work on Collatz this weekend so I should be able to dedicate most of my time to studying.
## What will you do next week?
  As aforementioned, I have an exam next Thursday along with our first project due on the same day. I will likely spend the beginning of next week ensuring my Collatz submission is ready and dedicate the rest of the week to studying for my exam. Furthermore, because the first project in my NLP class is group-based, I need to make sure I find time between studying to meet up with my group to work on that.
## What's your experience of learning the basics of Python?
  Fortunately, I have used Python at work and in previous classes so I have some prior knowledge of the language. However, I do enjoy the lectures as I didn't learn about Python in a formally structured way. The lectures do a good job of refreshing basic aspects that I have forgotten and have been very helpful in teaching concepts that I missed while learning the language on my own.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
  For those Google Chrome and vim, I recently discovered an interesting extension called [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium). Vimium allows users to navigate the web browser without the need for a mouse with keyboard controls that are similar to the ones used in the vim editor.
