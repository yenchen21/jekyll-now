## What did you do this past week?
This past week I mainly focused on finishing collatz and getting ready for
the career fair. On Thursday, I spent nearly the entire day networking with
companies through the FoCS brunch and the career fair.

## What's in your way?
Because I focused on getting assignments and projects finished early so I could
get prepared for the career fair, I neglected a lot of the assignments I had for my
online courses. I need to make sure I spend the weekend completely catching up
on my assignments in those courses so I don't fall behind.
## What will you do next week?
After a hectic and stressful week due to the career fair, I'm hoping to return
to a somewhat normal schedule. I plan on going to work an extra day to make up
hours for the time I missed for the career fair. In addition, I need to spend some time sending
follow up emails to the companies I talked to on Thursday and complete some
online applications. 
## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class continues to be positive as we continue to learn a 
lot about object-oriented programming concepts. However, I am a bit stressed about the quizzes as missing a single question is very costly but I'm sure Ill get used to it as the semester progresses.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
For those who like doing coding challenges in their free time, I would recommend
[Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com). This website is very similar to Hackerrank but
allows you to see the highest rated solution for each problem after your submission. I found this
decently helpful as it allowed me to learn a lot about how to optimize my code solutions.
