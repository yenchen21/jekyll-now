## What did you do this past week?
During the beginning of this past week, I mainly focused on finishing the first big project for my NLP class. Fortunately, my group delegated work efficiently and put in some extra work over the weekend ahead of the mid-week deadline. This allowed us to turn in the project without much stress as we did not have to worry about missing the deadline. Afterward, the rest of my week was spent getting ready and going to various career fair events. I attended the FoCS Career night and went to the Career Fair the next day. After two days of talking to recruiters and submitting applications, I was finally able to relax and celebrate my friend's birthday at the end of the week.
## What's in your way?
As of right now, nothing significant is currently in my way. However, I have felt that I have become less productive with my days than I have been in my previous semesters. With this semester being my last one of college and none of my classes having regular daily assignments, I have fallen into bad habits of laziness and procrastination. I'm hoping that the upcoming workload of the semester-long project in this class, along with more intensive NLP projects will force me to break out of these habits and be more productive with my days.
## What will you do next week?
Our group met briefly this weekend to plan out phase 1 of the semester-long project in this class so I plan to dedicate most of my time to work on my part of the project this next week. In addition, I plan to continue applying to different companies and follow up on applications that I have already sent out this past weekend.
## What did you think of the talk by Ed on GCP and Hannah on AWS?
I haven't had much experience with cloud services so both of the talks were very helpful and informative. However, I did find Ed's talk to be more biased towards the platform, which makes sense as he works for Google. Regardless, I enjoyed both of the talks and I hope Hannah posts her notes on AWS as it will be extremely helpful, especially during the setup of our projects.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
For those who own a Mac, I discovered [Launchbar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) when I first saw Professor Downing use it to quickly navigate through his file system when I took his other class a couple of semesters ago. Launchbar is an adaptive application launcher that allows you to navigate through your files and applications very quickly along with many more helpful features.
