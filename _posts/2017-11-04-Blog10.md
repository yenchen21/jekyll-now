# CS 371p Blog Post #10

## What did you do this past week?
This past weekend I attended my third HackTx. It was somewhat disappointing as 
one of our members wasn't able to make it in time and we ended up leaving early as
we had other obligations to take care of. The rest of the past week was mostly spent studying for my first midterm in my online
finance class. The midterm was the first exam I had to take using ProctorU and
it was by far the worst test-taking experience that I have gone through. It took the
proctor nearly 45 minutes to set up the service and
they required students to download a third-party application that allowed them complete
control of my machine. I understand the need to have this access but I was definitely
 not a fan of having to go through this entire process before taking my test.

## What's in your way?
I have another midterm in CS331 on Monday that I need to make sure I allocate plenty of
time to study for as the first midterm was fairly difficult. This and our next
project in this class are the two things currently in my way.

## What will you do next week?
The beginning of this next week will be completely focused on studying and taking
my CS331 midterm. Afterwards, the rest of my week before Thursday will be spent
finishing up our Darwin project and getting ready for a technical interview I 
have on Friday.
## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class is still very positive. I continue to stay engaged in 
the lectures and I especially enjoy how this project allows us some freedom in 
terms of creating OOP design.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is this [website](https://visualgo.net/en) that visualizes
data structure and sorting algorithms. This is a great way to familiarize or remind
yourself about how certain data structures and sorting algorithms work before technical
interview.
