## What are your expectations of the class?  
 Besides learning about the concepts of object oriented programming, I hope to
 become more familiar with C++ and the software development tools that we will 
 eventually use throughout the semester. My goal is to continue improving my 
 skills and knowledge around software development and I'm hoping this class will
 be a part of that process. 

## What did you do this past week?
With this past week being syllabus week, most of my time outside of class was spent getting ready for the fall semester which included getting textbooks, school 
supplies and planning out a new routine. 

## What's in your way?
I'm the type of person that likes to find a schedule or routine that I can follow
on a consistent basis. As a result, it always takes me some time to plan out and
get used to a new routine at the start of a new semester. This semester will be
especially interesting to plan around as it is 
the first semester that I will try to balance a job along with my classes. 


## What will you do next week?
Next week, I plan to continue attending lectures and going to work. I'm expecting
this upcoming week to be much busier as I imagine my professors will begin giving
us actual assignments to start working on.

## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class up to this point has been very positive. Professor 
Downing has kept the lectures interesting and I appreciate that despite it only 
being syllabus week, he has already given us a brief introduction to a software
development tool Docker, along with introducing the basics of C++.  

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Over the past year, I had been suggested to learn how to use Vim, a useful text 
editor built into most UNIX systems. At first, it was difficult 
as there are many shortcuts and key mappings to become familiar with before text editing
in Vim becomes practical. My tip-of-the-week is this 
[Vim shortcut cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com) along with the `vimtutor` terminal
command that helped me utilize this effective text editor.
