## What did you do this past week?
At the beginning of this past week, I focused most of my time with my group finishing up phase one for the project in this class. Fortunately, my group did a great job with planning out phase one so we were able to finish and meet the deadline without much stress. Afterward, I was able to dedicate the rest of my week to catching up on Biology readings and continuing my work on my other group project in NLP.
## What's in your way?
  With spring break on the horizon, there are quite a bit of project and exam deadlines coming up in the near future. I need to manage my time wisely to be able to study for my upcoming exams without neglecting my NLP project which is also due next week. Furthermore, I need to make sure I dedicate some time to planning out phase two of our project in this class with my group as there is quite a lot of work to do before the deadline after spring break.
## What will you do next week?
As aforementioned, next week will be an extremely busy week for me. I plan to briefly meet with my IDB group over this weekend to plan out our workflow for phase two. Afterward, I will likely spend the beginning part of the week working on my NLP project in hopes of getting to a point where I can feel comfortable focusing on studying for my exams the rest of the week. I hope to spend most of the week balancing studying time for the two exams I have at the end of the week.
## What was your experience of Project #2: IDB1?
My experience of Project #2: IDB1 was very positive. I haven't had much prior experience with front-end development so learning something new in React and HTML was exciting. Our group did a great job communicating and planning out this phase of the project which made the development process easier and generally stress-free.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
For phase one, a lot of the members in my group used the text editor [Atom](https://atom.io/) for our front-end development. Atom supports a number of packages that can make front-end development easier. Useful packages I've found are [language-babel](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel) for JSX syntax features, [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) to autoformat my code, and [plaformio-ide-terminal](https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide-terminal) that features a full terminal within the text editor.
