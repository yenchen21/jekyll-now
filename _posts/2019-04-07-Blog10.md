# CS 373 Blog Post #10

## What did you do this past week?
This past week was a relatively normal academic week as I had no major project deadlines or exams. This gave me time to catch up in my other classes and to make up some hours at work that I missed to meet my previous project deadlines. I focused mainly on catching up on assigned readings in my biology class to get ready for the exam I have next week. Also, I began working on phase 3 for our IDB project and started to rework our backend server to allow for sorting, filtering and searching. Outside of school, I used some of my free time to run in preparation for Longhorn Run and started planning potential summer trips with some of my friends before we start working full-time.
## What's in your way?
Currently, nothing significant is in my way other than my biology exam and Longhorn Run. For biology, this unit has considerably more content than the previous units so I need to make sure I budget significant time to study and prepare for the exam. Fortunately, because I will also have no major deadlines next week, I plan to be able to dedicate sufficient time to study. However, for Longhorn Run, I procrastinated too long before I started training this year and I'm not completely in running shape a week before the 10K run. I will likely need a miracle in order to not pass out before crossing the finish line.
## What will you do next week?
Next week, I plan to continue working on the backend server for our IDB project and hopefully finish implementing sorting, filtering and searching. However, most of my time will be spent studying and preparing for my biology exam at the end of the week. Outside of school, I plan to continue my last minute training for the Longhorn Run.
## What did you think of the talk by Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline?
I was very excited to have lectures taught by Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline as they were my professors for the UGS course that I took during my freshman year. I think ethics is an important but often forgotten aspect of computer science. I thought it was particularly interesting when they mentioned how ethics has to evolve alongside the evolution of technology.  
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would be the [meld](http://meldmerge.org/) tool. It a visual
diff and merge tool that I find very helpful in resolving merge conflicts with
version control.
