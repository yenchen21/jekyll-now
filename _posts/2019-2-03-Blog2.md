## What did you do this past week?
This past week, I began settling into a new routine for the semester. This included balancing work on various projects and assignments for my classes while going to work two days in the week. In addition, I found some time in my routine to stay active by finding times to go to the gym or go on a run. 
## What's in your way?
With career fair coming up in the next few weeks, I need to make sure I also budget my time to properly prepare for interviews. With this being my last semester, it is very important that I make sure I'm ready for my last career fair. Also, some of my classes this semester require a greater amount of daily reading so I need to make sure I do not fall behind when it comes to reading assignments.
## What will you do next week?
This next week, I plan to continue working on a big project for my NLP class as well as starting the first project for this class. Since I took Professor Downing's other class, Object Oriented Programming, I am familiar with the overall workflow of the projects which I am hoping will cut some of the needed time off this project. In addition, I plan to find a day during this next week to catch up and get ahead in my aforementioned class the requires daily readings.
## What's your experience of the in-class exercises? 
As aforementioned, I took a class under Professor Downing before so my experience of this class has been very similar. I have the same anxiety about the in-class quizzes as I did in the previous class but with a semester's worth of experience, I think I will be able to manage this aspect better. Also, I liked how Professor Downing ensured that everyone in the class is paying attention by cold calling students throughout the lecture.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
For those who like working in the terminal text editor, Vim, [here](https://vimawesome.com) is a website containing many useful plugins to expand its functionality. Useful plugins I found on this site added syntax checking, autocompletion, a useful file explorer, and different themes to customize the look of the editor.
