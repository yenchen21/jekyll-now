## What did you do this past week?
This past week was busier than usual as I had my biology exam at the end of the week along with the Phase 3 deadline for the IDB project coming up this next week. For most of the past week, I focused on studying and preparing for my biology exam. My biology professor noted that this exam would the most difficult of the semester so I dedicated more time than usual to read and prepare for the exam. Additionally, our group had made little progress on Phase 3 for IDB so I spent some time refining and reworking our backend to meet the new requirements for this phase.  Furthermore, I had the Longhorn Run 10K at the end of the week so I spent some time after school work each day to do some last minute training for the event.
## What's in your way?
Currently, nothing too significant is in my way. The Phase 3 deadline for the IDB project is coming up next week but our group has made significant progress over the past week and weekend to be in a comfortable position to finish on time. Otherwise, I find it harder and harder to stay focused as the end of my last semester approaches so I need to make sure I find ways to stay motivated and finish out college strong.
## What will you do next week?
During the beginning of next week, I will be focused on finishing Phase 3 for IDB. As aforementioned, our group made substantial progress over the last week and weekend so I feel fairly comfortable that we won't be stressed to meet all the requirements at the deadline like we were during the last phase. The rest of the week will be spent focusing on my other project in NLP and keeping up with my biology readings. 
## What was your experience in learning about regular expressions and SQL? 
Fortunately, I have had previous experience with regular expressions and SQL from work before this class. However, it was helpful to learn these concepts in a structured way. I found that the lectures helped reinforce what I already knew and taught me some basics that I missed while learning regular expressions and SQL on my own.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
When I was learning regular expressions for the first time, a helpful website I found was [regex101](https://regex101.com/). Regex101 is a useful website that allows you to test regular expressions on an input body of text. Also, after mastering the basics of regular expressions, you can go play [Regex Golf](https://alf.nu/RegexGolf) where you try to write regular expressions that will match a list of words while not matching another list of words. In this game, the lower the number of characters you use in your regular expression, the better the score you will get for that match.
