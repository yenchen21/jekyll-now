# CS 371p Blog Post #9


## What did you do this past week?
The first part of this past week, I completed the project we had for this class
with my partner and finished up some weekly assignments I had in my other classes.
This allowed me to go back home on Thursday and meet with my family for my father's
birthday. I haven't gone home in quite a while so I was glad that I was able to 
finish my assignments early so I could do so. The week ended with a full day of
catching up in my online class and going to HackTx on the weekend. 
## What's in your way?
My second round of midterms is coming up so making sure I sufficiently prepare
for all my exams in currently in my way. I need to find a balance between work
and my normal academic responsibilities, all while setting time aside to study
for these exams.
## What will you do next week?
This next week will mostly be focused on getting ready for my online FIN320F test
on Thursday. This will be my first test using ProctorU so I am a bit nervous
to see how this new testing experience will be. Along with studying, I plan to
also continue going through my normal weekly work and academic schedule.
## What's my experience of the class?
My experience in the class is still very positive. Recently, the class topics have
started to get a bit confusing with all the different little details associated with
the various constructors so I need to make sure I continue to stay engaged in the
lectures. 
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
With interview season still in session, I wanted to share [this website](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-preparation-for-software-developer/) that I use to
prepare for my technical interviews. It contains various technical interview tips as
well as solutions to common technical topics asked in interviews.
