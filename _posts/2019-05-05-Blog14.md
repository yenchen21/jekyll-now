# CS 373 Blog Post #14

## What did you do this past week?
This past week, I mainly dedicated my time on finishing up the IDB project with my group. It has been a long and fun semester project but our group was glad to finally finish our website and wrap up all the hard work we put into it. Afterward, I shifted my focus to the extremely busy week I have ahead. I met with my biology group to discuss our video project and began studying for some of the exams I have coming up. To relieve some stress, my group of friends started playing some racquetball at the end of the week. I ended up beating our TA in quite a lot of matches so hopefully, he forgets that before he starts grading and I can pass this class.

## What's in your way?
Although there is only a week left in my college career, there is quite a lot in my way. This last week will be extremely busy with projects, finals and last assignments for my classes. Fortunately, I do not need to work any more hours at work which will give me some extra time to grind out some of these obligations.

## What will you do next week?
As I mentioned before, this next week will be swamped with assignments and exams. I will begin the week by finishing up a video project in biology with my group and prepping for the IDB presentation in class on Monday. The rest of the week will be split up between studying for my two finals in biology and in this class while finding time to work on another project for my NLP class. It will be a busy week but I'm hoping to have some energy left at the end of the week to celebrate finishing classes with my friends.

## What did you think of the talk by Miriam?
I enjoyed the talk by Miriam, probably more than any other talk we have had during this semester. What I enjoyed most is that she didn't need a powerpoint or a pre-made presentation and it felt more like a conversation between her and the class. It was interesting to hear her unique story and journey to where she is today.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
After two semesters of writing this blog, I'm running out of useful picks of the week. So here's a list of [20 fun, but mostly useless Linux commands](https://www.binarytides.com/linux-fun-commands/) if you ever get to that point of boredom.
