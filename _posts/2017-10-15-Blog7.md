## What did you do this past week?
The first part of this past week was spent studying for our first test of the semester in
this class. Studying for this test was a bit more stressful than my other one as
this test was later in the week, making it difficult to find long contiguous
blocks of free time to study between school and work. Fortunately, I was able
to collaborate with some other people in my class on a study outline and the
cheat sheet, resulting in a much more manageable process to get ready for the test. 
The test on Thursday was a new experience for me as it was the first test I have
taken in college that required me to bring my own laptop to take it on.
## What's in your way?
Because I just finished my first round of tests, nothing too significant is 
standing in my way. I do need to catch up on my online class as I sacrificed making progress in that to
allocate time to study for our test. I also have another interview
for an internship this week so I need to make sure I prepare sufficiently for that as well.
## What will you do next week?
As I mentioned above, most of this next week will be spent catching up in my online class
and preparing for my interview on Tuesday. I also expect to begin preparing and
working on our next project in this class as well as resuming a normal schedule in terms of 
assignments in my other classes. 
## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class continues to be positive. I was interested to see how the test
would go as I had never had to bring my own laptop to take a test but I did not
find the format to be any more stressful than my other tests. 
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
As I get through my first round of midterms, I cannot stress the effectiveness
of studying in a group. Especially if I'm struggling in a particular class, I find
that studying with a group of my peers has greatly helped me when it comes to tests. 
Here's an [article](https://www.montclair.edu/media/montclairedu/residentialeducation/pdffiles/Study-Group-Tips-and-Advantages-1.pdf)
echoing my sentiments.
