## What did you do this past week?
As this past week was the first week of school, I spent some time outside of class getting ready for the upcoming semester. This included getting textbooks, school supplies and marking down any available test, project, and assignment due dates for my classes.
## What are your expectations of the class?  
I have taken a similar course in CS371p with Professor Downing before so, fortunately, I already have a good idea on how the class is structured. As for the material, I have little experience in web development, so I hope to learn new development tools and technologies that are involved in the process of making a website. I'm always looking to continue improving my skills and knowledge around software development and I think this class will be a good way of doing so.
## What's in your way?
Especially after a long break, I often find it difficult to transition into a new routine now that the semester has started. With different class times and workloads along with my decision to continue working at my job during the semester, I have to create a new routine to make sure I can fulfill my academic and work responsibilities while maintaining some time for other activities outside of the classroom. For example, I plan to participate in the Longhorn Run later in the semester so I need to make sure I get into the habit of finding time between work and class to run and go to the gym.
## What will you do next week?
Next week, I expect the workload of my classes to increase and my schedule to become much busier so I plan to start working on any upcoming assignments and projects I have for my classes. In the process, I also plan to settle into a consistent routine based on the expectations and workloads of my classes.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

For anyone who is hosting their blog posts on github.io or another similar service that uses Markdown, here is a Markdown cheat sheet that might be useful. Markdown is the markup language used by Github and Gitlab for text formatting on the platforms and I found [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 
cheat sheet particularly helpful for formatting documentation and READMEs for my coding projects.
