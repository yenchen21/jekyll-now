# CS 373 Blog Post #12

## What did you do this past week?
This past week, I spent most of my time outside of class working with my group to finish phase 3 for Project: IDB. I had previously thought that our group was in a position where we could meet the deadline relatively stress-free. However, we ended up working multiple late nights this last week to meet even the extended deadline. Otherwise, I used the little free time I had outside of class to get back into a workout routine for the summer and catching up on biology readings.

## What's in your way?
I have another project due in NLP at the end of this week that I will need to start focusing on after finishing phase 3 for project IDB.  Unfortunately, my group members and I all had other obligations before this week so we've made little progress on the project. Aside from that, there is nothing significant in my way. I need to continue to maintain focus in school and finish out my last semester strong.

## What will you do next week?
As we have made little progress on the NLP project due next week, I will likely dedicate a significant portion of next week working on it with my group. Otherwise, I plan to catch up on some of the coursework in my other classes and maybe find an opportunity this week to play some squash with the boys.

## What was your experience of Project #4: IDB3?
My experience of Project #4: IDB3 was mostly positive, similar to the earlier phases. It was refreshing to be able to take a brief break from frontend development during the beginning of phase 3 to work on the backend and API which I am much more familiar with. However, I wish that Professor Downing would have been more clear about the requirements needed for Phase 3, especially for searching. Fortunately, the TAs and Downing were very helpful in answering any questions we had but it would have been nice to have those directions during the beginning of the phase.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
As a group of my friends began planning for a summer trip, we found that [Splitwise](https://secure.splitwise.com/) to be a useful tool for keeping track of shared expenses. Splitwise allows you to track any shared expenses you have with friends, roommate, etc. so that everyone in the group knows what they owe and to who they owe money.
