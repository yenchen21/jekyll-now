## What did you do this past week?
This past week I spent most of my time studying for my biology exam and finishing up the Collatz project for this class. Fortunately, I was able to finish most of Collatz over the past weekend so the majority of my work on the project during the week was making sure I had completed all the necessary requirements for it to be submitted. With little time needed to finish up Collatz, I was able to devote most of my week preparing for my Friday biology exam. In addition, I have a group project due next week for my NLP class so I made sure to meet up with my group to avoid falling behind for that deadline.
## What's in your way?
The CNS career fair is next week alongside the due date for my first NLP project. I need to make sure I budget enough preparation time to have a productive career fair while finishing this group project. However, our group was able to make substantial progress on the project over the weekend so that hopefully lessens the time I need to dedicate to the project during the week.
## What will you do next week?
With the career fair and the project deadline, I expect the beginning of next week to the busiest time I have had so far this semester. After the project and the career fair, I hope to have some time to relax and maybe even play some squash with the boys.
## What's your experience of Project #1 (the problem, the overkill requirements of submission, etc.)?
As I mentioned in previous blog posts, I took Professor Downing's Object Oriented Programming class which had a similar first project so I already had some optimizations and implementations in mind. Although there were some annoyances in the project workflow, I think that some of Professor Downing's requirements will ultimately instill some beneficial coding practices and habits. The only slight issues I had with project 1 was the modification of some of the project requirements close to the due date and the inability to submit the project if I had finished it days before the deadline.
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
For those who are familiar with Markdown, [Typora](https://typora.io/) is a markdown editor that features a live preview that automatically converts markdown syntax as you type. I found this to be an easy way to make organized and clean notes for many of my classes.
