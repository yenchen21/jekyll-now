# CS 371p Blog Post #11

## What did you do this past week?
This past week was mainly spent completing our Darwin project in this class. In my
opinion, this project took the most time and work just due to how much freedom
we were given in designing our solution. It took some time to plan out and debug
our initial implementation. Besides this project, the rest of my week was focused
on getting ready for a technical interview with the BHW group I had on Friday.
## What's in your way?
With my second round of midterms and the most recent project in this class
out of the way, there isn't anything significant standing in my way. I need to 
make sure I stay focused on my online class so I do not fall behind for the final
coming up in a few weeks.
## What will you do next week?
Like I mentioned before, this next week will be less busy than my previous weeks
so I will likely follow a normal academic and work schedule for the week. I plan
to take advantage of this and make significant progress in my online class so I have
ample time to prepare for the final.
## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class continues to be very positive. I continue to see the
benefits of being in the class during technical interviews. The OOP concepts we are
learning are very helpful to know when it comes to technical interview questions. 
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would be the [meld](http://meldmerge.org/) tool. It a visual
diff and merge tool that I find very helpful in resolving merge conflicts with
version control.
