# CS 371p Blog Post #12

## What did you do this past week?
This past week was one of the most relaxed weeks I have had in a while as I had just finished my second round of midterms and the latest project in this class. I took advantage of not having much due this past week to get ahead in my online finance class in preparation for the final that is coming up in a few weeks. In addition, I spent some time preparing for an interview I had on Friday and setting up our next project for this class with my partner.  
## What's in your way?
With Thanksgiving break next week, nothing too significant is in my way. However, with our project being due very soon after we come back from break, I need to make sure I plan appropriately with my partner so that we can finish the project without having to take away much time from our break.  
## What will you do next week?
This next week is short due to Thanksgiving break so I plan to finish a couple assignments I have due before the break before going home for Thanksgiving. I also plan to meet with my project partner to complete as much of the project as we can so that we can enjoy our break without having to worry about meeting up to work.  
## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class continues to be positive. I really enjoy the freedom that Professor Downing has given us in these last two projects and I continue to stay engaged in his lectures.  
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Recently, I switched over to using a MacBook from using a Windows laptop for most of my life. The first thing I noticed was that there was not a way to quickly resize my windows so that I could view multiple applications at once. This feature was built in on Windows so I wanted to look for a similar feature on OSX and found the application [shiftit](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt). I find this application to be one of the most useful add-ons for my MacBook and use it all the time to quickly resize my windows whenever I need to.
