## What did you do this past week?
This past week, I returned to a typical school week routine and began working on
project 2 for this class. At the end of the week, I also participated in an outreach
event at Cedar Ridge High School with the UT Computer Science Roadshow organization. We spoke to a small class about various fields of computer science in hopes to raise awareness and interest in our field among these high school students.  

## What's in your way?
With interviews for internships are coming up, I need to make sure I am able to 
balance time for interview preparation and my normal academic and work responsibilities. 
## What will you do next week?
This next week, I'm expecting to continue following a typical weekly routine. During the first part of the week, my partner and I will work on and hopefully complete project 2 for this class. In addition, the first round of tests is coming up so I plan to
compile notes and test resources so I can start studying for those tests.
## What's my experience of the class?
My experience of the class is still very positive. I continue to be engaged in the lectures and I'm learning a lot, especially when we went over r-values and l-values this past week. As the semester progresses, I need to make sure I continue to stay engaged so I
don't miss any details that could be on a quiz or test. 
## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Recently, I have been using LaTeX to format homework assignments that need to be turned 
in online to canvas. This is especially useful for formatting math equations or proofs that are difficult to format in a normal word processor. The resources that I referred to when I first starting using LaTeX was this [editor](overleaf.com) and this helpful [guide](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr10/cos433/Latex/latex-guide.pdf).
